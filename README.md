## Thoughts before heading in

My first impression is that this shouldn't be as hard as it seems like on the surface, but I honestly think that it is gonna take a while exclusively on the face value that front-end stuff is very time consuming for me, mainly because I have to go back and forth between documentation and the actual project to make *anything* work, but hey, that's the way things are sometimes.

The greatest challenge for me is probably gonna be the fact that I'm a little bit rusty with event programming and all that functional stuff, hopefully it won't be that bad and I'll be on top of the situation in no time.

This project is supposed to be a pair programming one, but, I have a very irregular schedule right now, and I don't know if I'll be able to responsibly handle the project on a base organizational level if another person steps in, so, sorry Odin Project for letting you down.
